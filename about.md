Currently in my second year at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, I'm majoring in Broadcasting with minors in Music, Music Technology, Mathematics and Informatics. I have been writing for The Daily Nebraskan since January 2016 and have published more than 25 articles. I'm interested in telling stories with data and creating visuals to allow readers to interpret that data.

Through my experiences thus far, I've used Python, Ruby, HTML and CSS, but I'm always looking to learn more. 

Other quirks about me: I love organizing my calendar, I'll never turn down a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and I have [performed in Lucas Oil Stadium for more than 10,000 attendees.](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fa%2Fumn.edu%2Ffile%2Fd%2F0B-8UnmWNW3_iZmZBenBGRkdrdHc%2Fview%3Fusp%3Dsharing&h=ZAQGh50FS)
